# Data Analytics Project with R : Bellabeat Comapny

###  Introduction

The purpose of this study is to showcase the practical tasks of a data analyst. To address essential business inquiries, I will be utilizing the data analysis process, which includes steps such as asking relevant questions, preparing and processing data, analyzing the data, sharing insights, and taking action.

### About Bellabeat Company

Bellabeat is a high-tech company founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur that creates smart products focused on women’s health. By collecting data on various aspects of health, Bellabeat empowers women with knowledge about their own health and habits. The company has grown rapidly and positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women, opening offices globally and launching multiple products. Bellabeat invests heavily in digital marketing, including Google Search, social media, and video ads on YouTube. Sršen has tasked the marketing analytics team with analyzing smart device usage data to gain insight into customer behavior and inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### Scenario of the Case Study

In this research, I will examine one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze data obtained from smart devices to obtain a better understanding of how consumers use their devices. By gaining insights into customer behavior, the information obtained can then be used to inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy, allowing the company to make data-driven decisions.

## Asking the right questions(Ask Phase)

During the Ask phase, I conducted thorough research and asked a series of questions to understand the data and the problem at hand. The questions were: What are the current trends in smart device usage? How can these trends impact Bellabeat’s marketing strategy? By understanding how customers use their fitness smart devices, Bellabeat can focus its marketing efforts on meeting their specific needs. Furthermore, I aimed to make high-level recommendations based on the trends to inform the company’s marketing strategy.Key stakeholders in this case study, include Urška Sršen, the company’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Sando Mur, a mathematician and Bellabeat’s co-founder, and the rest of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

### Business Task

Based on the insights gathered during the Ask phase,The business task is to analyze smart device usage data and gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.The insights gained from this analysis can drive important business decisions and help Bellabeat better understand their customers’ needs and preferences. This analysis will then be applied to one Bellabeat product in order to identify potential opportunities for improving the company’s marketing strategy.

## Preparing the data(Prepare Phase)

During this phase, I will proceed with the download and importation of the dataset. It is crucial to ensure that all data is appropriately organized and reliable. I will also apply sorting and filtering techniques to improve the dataset’s usability.

To obtain the necessary data, Bellabeat has recommended using publicly available information that examines smart device users’ daily behaviors from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data is a public domain dataset provided through Mobius that contains personal fitness tracker information from thirty Fitbit users. The dataset includes minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring output, providing information on daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can help analyze user behavior.

**The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using this**

It’s important to note that the dataset was generated from a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and December 5, 2016. The dataset comprises of 18 CSV files.

### Set up my Environment

To begin my analysis, I will set up my R environment by loading the necessary R packages. Additionally, I will load packages specifically designed for data cleaning to ensure my dataset is properly prepared for analysis.
